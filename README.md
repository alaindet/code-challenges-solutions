# Codewars.com solutions

This repository collects all my codewars.com *solutions* as well as *attempts*. Attempts have an `// ATTEMPT` comment on top. Every solution has a reference to the codewars website.

## Directory structure

The directory hierarchy follows this convention

```
/solutions/$LANGUAGE/$DIFFICULTY/$KATA_NAME
```

where

- `$LANGUAGE` can be `javascript`, etc.
- `$DIFFICULY` is based on the kyu system so `8kyu`, `7kyu`, `6kyu`... (lower number is more difficult)
- `$KATA_NAME` is simply a `kebab-case` transformation of the Kata's name, like `pascals-triangle` for "Pascal's Triangle"


## Languages used so far

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
