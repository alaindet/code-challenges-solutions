# Codewars.com solutions

This repository collects all my codewars.com solutions I'll come up with, from time to time. I usually solve katas in JavaScript using ES6 syntax to apply the learn-by-doing principles.

## Solutions

The directory hierarchy follows this convention

```
/solutions/$LANGUAGE/$DIFFICULTY/$KATA_NAME
```

where

- `$LANGUAGE` can be `javascript`, `php`, `python`...
- `$DIFFICULY` is based on the kyu system so `8kyu`, `7kyu`, `6kyu`... (lower is more difficult)
- `$KATA_NAME` is simply a `kebab-case` transformation of the Kata's name, like `pascals-triangle` for "Pascal's Triangle"
